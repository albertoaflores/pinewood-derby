# PinewoodDerby UI
This is a small project that provides a web-based UI to the sensor 
data used in Derby Magic.

## Building
This a Spring Boot based application. As such, running `mvn clean install` 
generates a java binary file that in turn can be executed (assuming you 
have java installed).

For the non-technical folks, I'll be creating other installation methods.

## Future Ideas
* Build an Electron binary (using NodeJS instead of Spring Boot)
* Create an installer for Spring Boot.
